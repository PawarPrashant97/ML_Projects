Implemented K-Means clustering to identify credit card customer segmentation and to define marketing strategy. Created 4 clusters based on transacting behavior of credit card holders.

Performed data standardization and applied PCA technique for dimensionality reduction.

### Business Context
This case requires trainees to develop a customer segmentation to define marketing strategy. The 
sample dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the 
last 6 months. The file is at a customer level with 18 behavioral variables. Expectations from the Trainees:

EXPECTATIONS FROM THE TRAINEES:

- Advanced data preparation: Build an ‘enriched’ customer profile by deriving “intelligent” KPIs
such as:\
•  MonthIy average purchase and cash advance amount\
•  Purchases by type (one-off, installments)\
•  Average amount per purchase and cash advance transaction\
•  Limit usage (balance to credit limit ratio)\
•  Payments to minimum payments ratio etc.
- Advanced reporting: Use the derived KPIs to gain insight on the customer profiles.
- Identification of the relationships/ affinities between services.
- Clustering: Apply a data reduction technique factor analysis for variable reduction technique and a clustering algorithm to reveal the behavioural segments of credit card holders Identify cluster. 
- characterisitics of the cluster using detailed profiling.
- Provide the strategic insights and implementation of strategies for given set of cluster characteristics
